CM1 Numerical Model, Release 19.8  (cm1r19.8)
31 March 2019


*****************************************************************************************
* NOTE: This github distribution contains Leigh Orf's LOFS code (see http://lofs.io)    *
* which allows for lossily compressed HDF5 output that performs very well for large     *
* distributed-memory simulations on supercomputers. This code works with MPI only; no   *
* serial version of CM1 with LOFS exists.                                               *
